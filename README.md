Analyze the image quality in the frequency domain and compare the performance of different SISR models

A new metric Energy signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) is defined to analyze the image quality in the frequency domain. The measure contribution spectrum is used to compare the performance of different SISR models.

Detailed explination of frequency analysis is available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ycsocaxbqijanku/MasterThesis_Deep_Learning_based_Super_Resolution_NianlongGu.pdf?dl=0
